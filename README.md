## 👋 Hi there, welcome to Voicesii!

I'm **Bjorn Louer**, the creator and developer behind **Voicesii** – a fun, creative, and secure platform where users can record and manage up to 10 unique voice clips, all from their browser.

### 🎙️ What is Voicesii?

Voicesii is all about giving your voice a space to live, play, and be shared. Whether you're making sound memes, voice notes, or just want a mini soundboard of your own voice — Voicesii makes it fast and simple.

### 📋 Moderator Tools

Moderators have access to a **dedicated login page** where they can review and manage **all submitted voice memos** from users. This helps keep the platform clean, fun, and community-friendly.
